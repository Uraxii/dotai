name: agent-workbench
description: Locally deployable agent workbench (knowledgebase vault + bd board hub + bdui web front end + hardened kb-svc/artifact-review containers) driven by ONE pure-Python CLI. Use to run knowledgebase clip/put/query, manage bd boards under the central hub, launch the board web UI, scaffold a repo's agent workspace, or record/audit an architectural or scope decision the moment it's settled ("record decision", "we decided", "log this decision").

# agent-workbench

One skill, one executable. Every tool is pure Python
(argparse, stdlib + the two pre-existing lxml/readability deps kb-clip
already used). No bash, no `.sh` shims. The CLI lives BESIDE the hardened
container, never inside its image.

```bash
AW=$HOME/.claude/skills/agent-workbench/agent-workbench
$AW <subcommand> [ARGS]
```

## Subcommands

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kb` | knowledgebase service client (see modes/kb.md for verbs and detailed walkthrough) |
| `bd` | bd board hub + bdui web front end (see modes/bd.md for verbs and detailed walkthrough) |
| `artifact` | artifact review service client (see modes/artifact.md for verbs and detailed walkthrough) |
| `install` | (un)install this repo's skill into `$HOME/.claude/skills/agent-workbench` |
| `init-workspace` | scaffold docs/kb + workstreams + bd board into a repo |
| `doctor` | prerequisite checks and install diagnostics |

For the full verb list and invocation examples for each subcommand family,
see the corresponding mode doc:
- `modes/kb.md` for kb verbs (clip/put/query/atomize/decision/enrich/embed/etc)
- `modes/bd.md` for bd verbs (init/add/sync/repos/path/status + issue operations + ui status)
- `modes/artifact.md` for artifact verbs (publish/feedback/status + new comment/reply/resolve)

## Never verify against the live stack

Verifying a change by probing the live stack, curling
`127.0.0.1:9099`/`9100`/`9101`, or running any `kb`/`bd`/`artifact` verb
without a `KB_SVC_*`/`BD_SVC_*`/`ARTIFACT_SVC_*` override, is NOT an
acceptable verification method. It permanently mutates the real vault, the
real board hub, or the real artifact store, and there is no delete verb to
undo it.

Verify against a throwaway instance instead. In a repo checkout that is
`scripts/ephemeral-service.py`, and `--help` documents it. A copy-installed
skill has no repo beside it and should not be verifying services at all.

## install / init-workspace

```bash
$AW install --copy
$AW init-workspace [TARGET_DIR] [--prefix PREFIX]
```

`install` puts this repo's skill dir at
`$HOME/.claude/skills/agent-workbench`. `--copy` is the production
install: a real copy pinned to the source commit, stamped into a marker
file the CLI reads back. `--link` is a dev symlink, and it makes the
installed skill track whatever branch that working tree has checked out,
that's why `--copy` is the default recommendation. `--uninstall`
removes a repo-owned install (symlink or stamped copy).

A `--copy` reinstall produces **exactly** the source tree: a module the
source has since deleted does not survive the upgrade. It only ever
replaces its own installs. If the target is a real directory with no
marker, or is not a directory at all, it refuses, leaves the target
untouched, and **exits 1**. Move the path aside yourself and re-run:

```
$ $AW install --copy
agent-workbench: refusing to overwrite /home/you/.claude/skills/agent-workbench
 -- real dir with no install marker, not this repo's own copy install.
 Move it aside yourself, then re-run install --copy.
$ echo $?
1
```

`doctor` reports which install shape you have and compares the pinned
commit against the source repo the marker records:

```
[OK]   skill install: pinned at c1b549c5c5af, matches repo HEAD
[WARN] skill install: stale -- installed at deadbeefdead, repo HEAD is now c1b549c5c5af
[WARN] skill install: pinned at deadbeefdead, installed from /gone/repo which no longer exists; staleness could not be checked
```

A check that could not actually compare is always `[WARN]`, never `[OK]`.

`init-workspace` scaffolds `docs/kb/` +
`workstreams/` + a bd board into a target repo. It builds no repo-local
search index: the searchable knowledgebase is the vault under `KB_HOME`,
indexed by the one indexer (`scripts/kb-index.py`) and searched with
`kb query`. Bringing the stack up is not a CLI verb either: see
"Deploy + hardening" below.

## How it differs from the old scripts

**Pure Python, single entrypoint.** The five separate shell scripts
collapse into one executable with subcommands. The `kb` family is now an
HTTP client of the knowledgebase service (which owns the vault outright,
no CLI code touches it), and `artifact` is the same shape against the
artifact review service; the `bd` family (former `hub`/`board`) and
`init-workspace` are genuine rewrites. kb- and bd-specific audit fixes
are documented in their own mode docs above.

## Deploy + hardening

`docker-compose.yml` at the repo root is the ONE supported way to bring
the stack up. There is no `deploy` subcommand and no systemd quadlet
layer: the CLI never starts, stops, or builds a container.

```bash
podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d               # kb-svc + bd-svc + artifact-svc + bdui
podman-compose --profile n8n -f docker-compose.yml up -d # adds n8n
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d               # same file, docker host
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d               # standalone binary, docker host
```

The compose file carries the hardening (read-only rootfs, `cap-drop=ALL`,
`no-new-privileges`, seccomp default, digest-pinned base image,
HEALTHCHECK, narrowed mounts, ports bound to 127.0.0.1, the pinned n8n
image digest). n8n sits behind a `profiles: ["n8n"]` entry, so a plain
compose-up matches its intentionally-down state. Hardening rationale and
the env config surface are documented in
`docs/agent-workbench-hardening-plan.md`.

bdui (the bd board web front end) is on by default in compose and
publishes at `http://127.0.0.1:3100`. See `modes/bd.md` for details.

Optional data-root overrides live in
`$HOME/.claude/skills/agent-workbench/agent-workbench.env.example`. NOTE:
`KB_HOME` / `ARTIFACTS_HOME` are NOT functional overrides once the
containers are running (compose binds the paths at container start); only
`BEADS_HUB_DIR` is read directly by the Python code. See the env.example
comments.

artifact-svc's publish endpoint is enabled and loopback-only (127.0.0.1-bound).
It is driven by `artifact publish` and is the only publish path.
See `modes/artifact.md` for the full detail.

## n8n public API

n8n integration is currently inactive and not driven through this CLI.
See https://github.com/TODO/agent-workbench/issues/TODO for status.
