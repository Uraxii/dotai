### Opening a PR

Invoked at the end of every other playbook.

**Worktree.** Work from a git worktree off main; subagents inherit it. Multiple `Agent` calls on the same branch each get their own worktree, or `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/<branch>` between them. Dirty branch with unrelated work: patch out, fresh worktree, apply. Snarled worktree: reset from main, redo minimally. Before you commit, merge, or deploy from a worktree, run `git status` and read the tree you are about to ship.

**Skeptic review.** New code opens a PR only after its skeptic review passes (poteto-mode's [Skeptic review](../SKILL.md#skeptic-review)). The Prototype playbook opens no PR.

**Commits.** Commit liberally; rebase into small, ordered commits before opening PRs. Each commit is a future PR: landable, ordered to tell the story. Amend when the fix belongs in a just-made commit; new commit when separable.

**Writing Pull-Requests.** Read the `write-pr` skill before you write a PR title or description, and follow it.

**Forge.** Resolve the forge before the first PR operation and keep that choice for create, edit, view, watch, and merge. GitHub CLI (`gh`) is the default. If `command -v origin` succeeds and Origin can resolve the repository, prefer `origin pr ...`; if Origin is absent or cannot resolve the repository, stay on `gh` and record the fallback. Do not require Graphite (`gt`).

**Size and stacks.** Prefer five narrow PRs to one large PR. A stack is a base-branch chain. The root PR targets trunk; each child branch rebases onto its parent's exact tip and its PR targets the parent branch. Create a child with `origin pr create --status open --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr create --base <parent-branch>` according to the resolved forge. Retarget an existing child with `origin pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>` or `gh pr edit <pr> --base <parent-branch>`. Branch from trunk only for independent work. Rebase on trunk before substantial stack work.

**Babysit.** Opening a PR does not start a babysit. Post the URL and keep building. Finish the phase or stack first. Run a separate babysit pass only when the user asks for one after the whole stack exists, per `babysit.md`. A babysit for each new PR stalls the build and spends checks on commits that later waves restart. Push back when feedback drifts from intent.

A subagent that opens a PR runs `interrogate`, `/deslop`, and `/no-comments`. It returns the URL and does not babysit. Return to the parent.
